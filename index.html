        <h1>TRAVEL TO SLOVAKIA, EUROPE</h1>
        
        <p><em>Some texts i used in this project is from webpage <strong>https://wearetravelgirls.com/slovakia-things-to-do/</strong> and pictures are from <strong>https://www.wikipedia.org/</strong></em><br><br><br>

        <p><strong>Slovakia</strong>, small country in the middle of Europe, has so much to offer. Here are my top 6 reasons why international travellers should give my lovely country Slovakia a chance.<br><br>Slovakia is often forgotten and overlooked, and if it’s not, it’s usually only the capital <em>Bratislava</em> or the <em>High Tatra Mountains</em>, that people visit.</p>
        
                <p class="reasons"><strong>6 reasons to visit this extraordinary country</strong>:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>UNSPOILED AND UNTOUCHED</li>
            <li>RICH IN HISTORY</li>
            <li>AMAZING MOUNTAINS</li>
            <li>BREATHTAKING CAVES</li>
            <li>MANY NATIONAL PARKS</li>

        </ol>
        
        
        <h2>UNSPOILED AND UNTOUCHED</h2>
        
        <p>Nowadays it can be quite difficult to find a unique destination. Slovakia is still ‘off-the-beaten-path’, undiscovered by masses of tourists. I believe that it’s only a matter of time when more and more travellers will discover its beauty and start to visit. <strong>Our nature is still unspoiled and relatively untouched</strong> and you can find many peaceful places here without too many people around.</p>

        <h2>RICH IN HISTORY</h2>
        
        <p>We may be a young country, but our history and culture are rich. Slovakia’s cities are hundreds of years old with many festivals throughout the year. The way of life in the past used to vary in every Slovak region, so their local culture, folk costumes, and traditional dances differ from village to village and town to town.<br><br>I would recommend checking-out our <strong>traditional dance performances</strong> in our national costumes accompanied by live bands. The most popular dance groups are <em>Lucnica</em> and <em>Sluk</em>, which represent the best of our <em>folklore and dance art</em>.</p>

        <h2>AMAZING MOUNTAINS</h2>
        
        <p>I mentioned at the beginning of the <strong>High Tatras Mountains</strong>, which are our national pride, but most of the Slovak landscape is basically covered by different mountain ranges. In summer they offer great hikes for all types of adventurers – easier or more challenging ones, and during winter they turn into a white wonderland with great slopes and various <em>winter festivals</em>.

        <h2>BREATHTAKING CAVES</h2>
        
        <p>Yes, Slovakia is remarkable on the surface, but do you know what’s hiding underground? A whole new world of amazing and unique caves.<br><br>
For example, <strong>Dobsinska Ice Cave</strong> is covered in ice all year round and is rated as one of the most remarkable ice caves in the world. <strong>Ochtinska Cave</strong> is one of the three caves in the world with rich natural decorations of aragonite – the two others are located in Mexico and Argentina.<br><br>
<strong>Cave Domica</strong> is part of the 25 km long cave system, which ends up in Hungary. When the underground waters are high enough, you can sail in small motorless boats on an underground river all the way to Hungarian cave Baradla.<br><br>
Those are only three, so imagine that we have <strong>over 7 thousand caves</strong> and you can visit 12 of them.

        <h2>MANY NATIONAL PARKS</h2>
        
        <p>Our national parks are not only about hiking – they offer an attractive mix of activities. You can try ‘Slovak rafting’ on <strong>Dunajec River</strong> on flat wooden rafts with a tour guide in our folk costume taking you through our majestic mountain ranges.<br><br>
Try walking on top of the trees in Bachledova Valley, chase waterfalls in Slovak Paradise National Park, find your inner kid on bobsleds in the High Tatras or just relax in a spa in one of our world-class hotels.

        <h2>TRADITIONAL VILLAGES WITH UNIQUE FOLK ARCHITECTURE</h2>
        
        <p>You don’t need a time machine to travel back in time. Just visit one of our <strong>traditional villages</strong> with picturesque wooden houses and decorative paintings and you’ll suddenly find yourself in a fairy tale.<br><br>
Villages <strong>Cicmany</strong> and <strong>Vlkolinec</strong> from the 13th – 14th centuries look like open-air museums but they are real. The houses are still in use and elderly inhabitants still wear traditional clothes.<br><br>
You can book a night or two (or more) here and enjoy this different world that you will hardly find anywhere else.
